## Backend Integration

The frontend expects the following API endpoints from your Flask backend:

- `GET /products` - Get all products
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order
- `GET /orders` - Get all orders (for admin)

## Key Features

### 1. Local Storage Cart
- Cart items persist between browser sessions
- No user authentication required
- Items stored with product details and selected options

### 2. Order Flow
1. Customer browses products
2. Adds items to cart (stored locally)
3. Proceeds to checkout
4. Fills contact information (name, phone, address)
5. Order submitted to backend
6. Customer receives order confirmation
7. Admin can view order in dashboard

### 3. Admin Dashboard
- View all orders from backend
- Contact information display
- Order status management

## Important Note

The current Flask backend's Order model doesn't include customer information (name, address, phone). To fully utilize the frontend features, consider updating the backend Order model to include customer details.
